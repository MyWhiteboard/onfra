                                9. Relationship of the Parties; No Third Party Beneficiaries. The parties

                                employment relationship between the parties. There are no third
                                party beneficiaries to these Terms.

                                any provision of these Terms to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable,
                                the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect, and
                                such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
                                make it valid, enforceable and legal.
                            </span>

                                provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or
                                provision unless acknowledged and agreed by My Whiteboard in
                                writing.
